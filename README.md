## Physics Manager Notes

The job of the physics manager is to:

1. Calculate the gravitational forces acting on each object influenced by gravitational forces
2. Move all the objects in space through integrating acceleration
3. Handle intersecting objects by moving them back until they are no longer intersecting
4. Calculate and apply impulses to colliding objects
